# 🎥 getvideofastbot

A simple Telegram bot that lets you **download public short-form videos** quickly — no watermark, no extra apps.

Built as a fun challenge to explore Telegram bots, Node.js, and video processing.

---

## ✨ Features

- 📥 Download videos from supported platforms:
  - Instagram Reels
  - TikTok (standard + shortened links)
  - X (Twitter) videos
  - Facebook (public videos only)
- 🚀 Fast downloads using `yt-dlp`
- 🎞 Automatically compresses videos if they’re too large
- 🤖 Easy to use — just send a link
- 🌐 Hosted as a web service with a lightweight keep-alive server
---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Send a supported video link to the bot
2. The bot:
   - Fetches video metadata
   - Checks duration and file size
   - Downloads the video
   - Compresses it if needed
3. The video is sent back directly in Telegram

Temporary files are cleaned up automatically.

## 🌍 Deployment Notes
* Designed to run as a web service (not a background worker) 
* Includes a minimal Express server to prevent free-tier sleeping 
* Tested on Render 
* Only one instance should run at a time (Telegram polling limitation) 

---

## ⚠️ Limitations
* ❌ YouTube Shorts are not supported (login restrictions) 
* ⏱ Videos longer than the configured duration are rejected 
* 🔒 Private or restricted videos may fail to download 
* 📉 Free hosting platforms may occasionally restart the service
* ⚠️ Facebook support is best-effort (public links only)


## 📌 Example Usage
Send a link like: 
https://www.instagram.com/reel/XXXXXXXX/

https://vt.tiktok.com/XXXXXXXX/
or 
https://x.com/username/status/XXXXXXXX

The bot handles the rest.
